Junior Developer Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This is a collection of projects I've built to showcase my skills and experience as a junior web developer. Below, you will find details on the various projects I've worked on, focusing on React, Redux, and front-end development.

Projects
1. Task Planner App
A task management web app built with React. This project allows users to:

Register and log in with encrypted credentials.
Add, edit, delete, and organize tasks by priority and status.
Filter and sort tasks by various criteria.
2. Weather App
A weather app displaying real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Features include:

Current weather and 7-day forecast.
Search functionality for multiple locations.
Customizable themes and unit options.
Offline access with cached weather data and notifications for severe weather.
3. Shopping List App
A full-featured shopping list application with CRUD functionalities for managing shopping lists. Key features include:

Add, update, delete, and view shopping lists with categories, quantities, and item images.
Search, sort, and filter items by name, category, and date.
User authentication with protected routes and personal shopping list management using Redux.
4. Recipe Manager App
A recipe management app that allows users to:

Add, view, edit, and delete recipes.
Organize recipes by category (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).
Upload recipe images and search by name or category.
Secure user authentication and authorization with user-specific data.
Technologies Used
React for building interactive UIs.
Redux Toolkit for state management.
Bootstrap for responsive design and styling.
React Router for navigation and routing.
JSON Server for data persistence and API simulation.
Bcrypt.js for encrypting passwords.
Axios for making HTTP requests.
Available Scripts
In this project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

npm run eject
This command removes the single build dependency and provides full control over the configuration files.

Learning and Development
This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:

Build responsive and user-friendly web applications using React and Redux.
Implement authentication, state management, and CRUD operations.
Manage data using JSON Server and perform operations with REST APIs.
